## Feedback and Feature Requests
If you found a bug or want to share an idea on how to improve my UI, either report to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ls-/ls_UI/issues?state=open) on my GitHub page, or use [Curse Ticket Tracker](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/ls-ui/tickets/), or post a comment on [WoWInterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662.html#comments) or [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ls-ui#comments).

Feel free to write feedback on how to improve some class-specific features, because I only play as PvE mage and PvP DK.

However, keep in mind that I'm not going to implement any features as a replacement for _BIG_ addons.

## FAQ
**Q:** Will you add party and/or raid frames?<br/>
**A:** Nope. I prefer using default compact party/raid frames. Moreover, there are quite many great party/raid addons on Curse and WoWInterface, pick whichever you like the most.
